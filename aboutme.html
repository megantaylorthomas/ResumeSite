                        <h2>Hello and Welcome!</h2>
                        <p> My name is Megan Thomas and I am a software engineer, dog mom, and plant enthusiast. There
                            are a few places you can typically find me when I am not on the clock. The first is working
                            in my gardens. I love growing food, learning ways to consciously landscape, and supporting
                            local pollinators. During the Minnesota winters, I focus that energy on my ever-growing
                            collection of house plants. To learn more about my house plants check out my <a
                                href="http://meganswebconservatory.com/">web
                                conservatory</a>. Another place you can frequently find me is playing with my puppy
                            Watson! He is named after one of my favorite fictional characters, John H. Watson from Sir
                            Arthur Conan Doyleâ€™s Sherlock Holmes. I think he is just as smart and twice as handsome. You
                            can also find me listening to live music. Growing up in Detroit I had access to one of
                            the best music scenes in the nation. When I first moved to Minneapolis I was going to
                            concerts at First Avenue almost every month. Covid has put a hiccup in my concert-going
                            but I still see shows when I can. When I have extended free time I plan trips to the
                            national parks. There is nothing quite like exploring the most beautiful place with your
                            favorite people. I have been to a few parks including Joshua Tree, Death Valley, Smoky
                            Mountains, Olympic, the Grand Canyon, Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Great Sand Dunes, and Point
                            Reyes National Seashore. Want to know more about me? I am always open to getting coffee and
                            talking shop or just expanding my network. Feel free to reach out! </p>
