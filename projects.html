                        <h2>Megan's Web Conservatory</h2>
                        <h3>Personal Project</h3>
                        <p>Since my fascination for botany began I have wanted to combine that passion with my technical
                            skills. My web conservatory was my first foot in the door. This project serves several
                            purposes. As my house plant collection has grown I have found a need to showcase, catalog,
                            and manage my houseplants. After hours of research into botany in conjunction with my
                            personal experience, I have created a profile for each of my house plants. Every profile
                            contains key care information such as watering, light, and humidity. The profiles also share
                            interesting information on toxicity, expected growth, and the plant's origins. While the
                            website acts as an online catalog it also doubles as a plant identification system. Each of
                            my house plants has an identification tag containing a QR code. When friends or family have
                            questions about a house plant or possibly want one themself, they simply scan the tag, and
                            the plant profile is presented.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>The technical architecture behind the sites implements a CI/CD pipeline from my GitHub repo to an S3
                    bucket. The architecture behind the website is rather simple, as showcased in the diagram below. The
                    simplistic architecture is by design as it allows for straightforward support and modifications.
                    The code behind the project is a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although this website is
                    currently static, behind the scenes it is getting a makeover. I am in the process of adding each
                    plant profile to a DynamoDB instance. I have created a lambda function to query the DB which can be
                    called through an API gateway. Once I have added all plant profiles to the DynamoDB instance I will
                    rewrite the code to pull from the API on page load. While the cloud architecture, website, and QR
                    are nothing groundbreaking in terms of computing, what I would like to focus on is the application
                    of the technology. Having the option to pull up a plant profile with a click of a button makes
                    accessing information simple and easy. This is what I find as the most important part of the
                    project. Technology is only as powerful as how you choose to use it. Using technology to help others
                    learn is where my passions truly lie!

                        <p>Every developer needs a way to easily showcase some of their professional abilities. This
                            website accomplishes just that for me!
                            When learning more about AWS services I found how extremely simple to host and support a
                            website, so the cloud became the home of my online resume. The current architecture
                            behind the website is rather simple, as showcased in the diagram. The original
                            code is from <a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP!</a> which provides amazing
                            web templates that are free for both personal and commercial use. So I repurposed their code
                            for my purposes and learned a lot
                            about web development along the way. Using Route 53 for domain management and Code Pipeline
                            for CI/CD deployments creates straightforward support of the site.

                    <p>Some of the projects I have enjoyed the most have involved branching out from the normal software
                        technology stack I use and working with my hands! An easy and extremely affordable way I do
                        that is by building Raspberry Pi projects. I will not claim the software in either of
                        these projects is supremely innovative or unique. In fact, I did not write the majority of the
                        code myself. Like any wise developer, I believe there is no point in reinventing the wheel. An
                        important part of computing is learning how other developers' code works and optimizing it for
                        your purposes. I found great joy in building these projects and I use them frequently. </p>

                            modifications to make the application compatible with the 7-inch touchscreen Raspberry Pi
                            Display. I also made changes to display the prices of cryptos currently in my portfolio or
                            that I have my eye on. I used TinkerCad to design legs and a case for my display screen. To
                            print my designs I used an Ultimaker 3D printer and PLA plastics. This price ticker now sits
                            on my desk so I can easily monitor crypto prices while workign.

                        <h3>Personal Project</h3>
                        <p>Magic mirrors are one of the most popular computing projects out there. They are a great
                            first step for many developers into the world of Raspberry Pis. The software I selected was
                            posted by user <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror"> MichMich on GitHub</a>.
                            This project earn ranks with my others primarily because of the carpentry and computer
                            hardware experience I gained. At the start of this project, I was skeptical of my ability to
                            learn about the hardware with no documentation. Those doubts vanished as soon as I began
                            deconstructing the old LED TV from my childhood bedroom. I embedded the hardware for the TV
                            directly into the mirror frame to take advantage of the existing components such as a button
                            panel, input panel, and speaker system. This project currently lives in my powder room and
                            is a great reminder that I am capable of more than I know, I just have to try!</p>

                        <h3>Grand Valley State University Capstone Project</h3>
                        <p>Awareness of the environment's effect on our health has grown exponentially over time. Air
                            quality is one of the largest concerns. Even though air quality has a constant effect on our
                            health, accurate neighborhood-specific data is not available to the public. Without this
                            data, we can easily overlook an environmental factor that may disproportionately affect the
                            health of minority communities. This issue led us to the development of our senior capstone
                            project. The goal of our project was to create a community-focused, educational, web
                            application designed to inform Grand Rapids residents of air quality metrics. We have
                            several air quality sensors placed strategically around the city of Grand Rapids with the
                            help of our sponsors. The sensors collect and store the data locally until a network
                            connection, where it is then sent to an AWS DynamoDB. We cleaned, processed, and analyzed
                            the data using an AWS Lambda. On the front end, the data is presented as a heat map that
                            displays the pollution levels in each neighborhood of the city, as well as the sensor
                            locations. An additional feature on the web app is a tab dedicated to community access to
                            the air quality data we collect. This data is downloaded as a CSV with the click of a
                            button. Our project also includes a community outreach program that sends emails and texts
                            to registrants about relevant air quality conditions in their neighborhood or areas of
                            concern in the city. The goal of our project is to provide this data in an easy-to-use
                            manner that is accessible to all.</p>

                        <h2>Automated Car Identification System Using Tensorflow</h2>
                        <h3>Grand Valley State University Project</h3>
                        <p>The use case for our specific classifier is a Chevrolet service station. We could use our AI
                            to identify the next car in line to be serviced and pull up vehicle data before the mechanic
                            even gets to the car. Having knowledge of the next vehicle can help so that servicing
                            machines can automatically adjust to focus on that vehicle. Examples include switching the
                            types of oil being pumped through the valve, having an order list generate based off of the
                            vehicle’s parts, having recall information show automatically, and general information
                            regarding maintenance frequency. To bring this idea to fruition, it took searching for a
                            data set, creating a data manipulation script, creating and training our model, and lastly
                            building the UI. Tensorflow makes it extremely easy to create and train a neural network for
                            image classification. Its ease of use stems from its incorporation of the Inception V3
                            neural network into new projects. Inception V3 is a CNN that took about two weeks(on a
                            computer with 8 GPUs) to train on 1.2 million images. With the time constraints of our
                            project, using Inception V3 provides us with a more accurate base instantly. Also,
                            Tensorflow allowed us to work with complex deep learning techniques on a higher level. After
                            we grasped the concepts of Tensorflow with Inception V3, we were able to dive deeper into
                            the lower level operations written in the code. Being that the interface was not the prime
                            concern of our project, we used PyQt with Designer to spin up a working demo. We also made
                            our GUI very modular so that our Tensorflow backend can be retrained and applied to
                            different use cases. In the retrain tab on our GUI, you can select a different dataset to
                            train on. After this model is trained, the new AI model will automatically work with our
                            classification front end. As a result, we’ve made image classification a ‘point-and-click’
                            operation, which opens the division of AI up to more people than ever.</p>

                        <h3>Grand Valley State University Project</h3>
                        <p>For this project, we created a shameless Pokémon knockoff with GVSU flare. This 2D game
                            follows your many adventures and battles at GVSU. The main goal of the game is the same
                            as college, to graduate. Challenge other students and professors on campus to gain
                            credits in order to complete your degree. Explore the campus while listening to the
                            tranquil sounds from the original Pokemon games and see what you can find! The game
                            opens up with an introduction from the sprite version of T. Haas (GVSU President)
                            welcoming the player to campus. After your orientation from T. Haas, you can explore the
                            landscape of our lovely campus, enter many of the buildings, and battle a variety of
                            characters you encounter along the way. GV Mon is an open-world game, meaning the user
                            can go anywhere at any time. As you explore the map, music will vary by location. Each
                            battle you win ups your health and attack strength as well as rewarding you with
                            credits. Once you acquire enough credits from winning your battles you can graduate!
