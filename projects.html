                        <h2>Megan's Web Conservatory</h2>
                        <h3>Personal Project</h3>
                        <p>When I am not on the clock you can often find me with plants in hand. For a long time, I have
                            wanted
                            to combine my passion for plants with my love for technology. My web conservatory was my
                            first foot
                            in the door. This project serves several purposes. As my house plant collection has grown I
                            have
                            been looking for a way to showcase, catalog, and manage my houseplants. After hours of
                            research into
                            botany in conjunction with my personal experience, I have created a profile for each of my
                            house
                            plants. Every profile contains key care information such as watering, light, and humidity.
                            The
                            profiles also share interesting information on toxicity, expected growth, and the plant's
                            origins.
                            While the website acts as an online catalog it also doubles as a plant identification
                            system. Each
                            of my house plants has an identification tag containing a QR code. When friends or family
                            have
                            questions about a house plant or possibly want one themself, they simply scan the tag, and
                            the plant
                            profile is presented.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                The technical architecture behind the sites implements a CI/CD pipeline from my GitHub repo to the
                S3 bucket. The current computer architecture behind the website is rather simple, as showcased in
                the diagram to the right. The code behind the project is a blend of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                Although this website is currently static, behind the scenes it is getting a makeover. I have been
                adding each plant profile to a DynamoDB instance. I also created a lambda function to query the DB
                which can be called through an API gateway (Architecture Diagram Below). The last piece I am working on is rewriting the website
                code to pull from the API on page load.

                While the cloud architecture, website, and QR are nothing groundbreaking in terms of computing, what
                I would like to focus on is the application of the technology. Having the option to pull up a plant
                profile with a click of a button makes accessing information simple and easy. This is what I find as
                the most important part of the project. Technology is only as powerful as how you choose to use it.
                Using technology to help others learn is where my passions truly lie! </p>

                        <h3>November 2020 - Present</h3>
                        <p>Every developer needs a way to easily showcase some of their professional abilities. This
                            website accomplishes just that for me!
                            When learning more about AWS services I found how extremely simple to host and support a
                            website, so the cloud became the home of my online resume. The current computer architecture
                            behind the website is rather simple, as showcased in the diagram to the left. The original
                            code was from HTML5 UP!<a href="https://html5up.net/">HTML5 UP!</a> which provides amazing
                            web templates that are free for both personal and commercial use. As I always say, there is
                            no use reinventing the wheel! So I repurposed their code for my purposes and learned a lot
                            about web development along the way. Using Route 53 for domain management and Code Pipeline
                            for CI/CD deployments also makes for easy support of the site.

                    <p>Some of the projects I have enjoyed the most have involved branching out from the normal software
                        technology stack I use and working with my hands! An easy, and extremely affordable, way I do
                        that is by building projects with Raspberry Pis. I will not claim the software in either of
                        these projects is supremely innovative or unique. In fact, I did not write the majority of the
                        code myself. Like any wise developer, I believe there is no point in reinventing the wheel. An
                        important part of computing is learning how other developers' code works and optimizing it for
                        your purposes. I found great joy in building these projects and I use them frequently. </p>

                            This user also has great documentation on installation for those who are unfamiliar. I made
                            modifications to make the application compatible with the 7-inch touchscreen Raspberry Pi
                            Display. I also made changes to display the prices of cryptos currently in my portfolio or
                            that I have my eye on. I used TinkerCad to design legs and a case for my display screen. To
                            print my designs I used an Ultimaker 3D printer and PLA plastics. This price ticker now sits
                            on my desk so I can easily monitor crypto prices.

                        <p>Personal Project
                            Magic mirrors are one of the most popular computing projects out there. They are a great
                            first step for many developers into the world of Raspberry Pis. The software I selected was
                            posted by user <a href="https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror"> MichMich on GitHub</a>..
                            This project earn ranks with my others primarily because of the carpentry and computer
                            hardware experience I gained. At the start of this project, I was skeptical of my ability to
                            learn about the hardware with no documentation. Those doubts vanished as soon as I began
                            deconstructing the old LED TV from my childhood bedroom. I embedded the hardware for the TV
                            directly into the mirror frame to take advantage of the existing components such as a button
                            panel, input panel, and speaker system. This project currently lives in my powder room and
                            is a great reminder that I am capable of more than I know, I just have to try!</p>

                        <h3>Grand Valley State University Capstone Project</h3>
                        <p>Awareness of the environment's effect on our health has grown exponentially over time. Air
                            quality is one of the largest concerns. Even though air quality has a constant effect on our
                            health, accurate neighborhood-specific data is not available to the public. Without this
                            data, we can easily overlook an environmental factor that may disproportionately affect the
                            health of minority communities. This issue led us to the development of our senior capstone
                            project. The goal of our project was to create a community-focused, educational, web
                            application designed to inform Grand Rapids residents of air quality metrics. We have
                            several air quality sensors placed strategically around the city of Grand Rapids with the
                            help of our sponsors. The sensors collect and store the data locally until a network
                            connection, where it is then sent to an AWS DynamoDB. We cleaned, processed, and analyzed
                            the data using an AWS Lambda. On the front end, the data is presented as a heat map that
                            displays the pollution levels in each neighborhood of the city, as well as the sensor
                            locations. An additional feature on the web app is a tab dedicated to community access to
                            the air quality data we collect. This data is downloaded as a CSV with the click of a
                            button. Our project also includes a community outreach program that sends emails and texts
                            to registrants about relevant air quality conditions in their neighborhood or areas of
                            concern in the city. The goal of our project is to provide this data in an easy-to-use
                            manner that is accessible to all.</p>
