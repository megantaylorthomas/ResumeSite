                        <p>During my time at 3M, my team and I were selected to participate in several AWS Classroom

                            migration initiative. The migration initiative focused on moving our current on-prem tools
                            to the AWS cloud and re-architecting them to use native AWS services. In the classes, we
                            focused on architectural tradeoffs, operational excellence, security, relatability,
                            scalability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. We were also provided with
                            access to Cloud Guru for self-guided learning. </p>
